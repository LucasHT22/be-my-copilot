# Be my Copilot
Be my copilot is a simple flight simulator experience based on Godot.

## How to fly?
It's a little trick but you can learn whatever you want, captain!

### Controls
To be the copilot of my life- I mean, the flight copilot - you need to understand that everything is under control.

- Page Up/Down = Throttle (engine power)
- Arrow Up/Down = Elevator (pitch up/down)
- Arrow Left/Right = Ailerons (roll/bank)
- Q/E = Rudder (yaw left/right)
- Home/End = Trim (adjust pitch balance)
- Enter = Flaps up/down
- Space = Brakes

### Takeoff
Let's start from here, the takeoff!

1. Full throttle -- Hold Page Up untill 100%
2. Speed up -- Let plane accelerate on runway to ~60 knots
3. Gentle pull -- Press Arrow Down slightly when you hit 60 knots
4. Climb -- Pitch up gently, aim for 70-80 knots climb speed
5. Retract Flaps -- Press Enter to put flaps up once airborne

### Cruise
Alright, start is hard but maintain can be tricky.

1. Level off -- Use Arrow Up to pitch down until horizon is level
2. Trim it out -- Use Home/End to adjust trim until plane flies straight without input
3. Reduce throttle -- Set to 70-80% for cruise
4. Maintain 90-100 knots

### Turns
Sometimes you need to make a move.

1. Bank -- Arrow Left/Right to roll 20-30 degrees
2. Add rudder -- Q or E in same direction (coordinated turn)
3. Slight back pressure -- Arrow Down a bit to maintain altitude
4. Level out -- Roll wings level when pointed where you want

### Landing
We need to refuel sometimes

1. Line up with runway -- Get on approach at ~500ft altitude
2. Flaps down -- Press Enter
3. Reduce throttle -- ~30%
4. Slow to 60-65 knots
5. Glide down -- Gentle descent, aim for runway threshold
6. Flare -- Just before touchdown, gently pull back (Arrow Down)
7. Touch down -- Let it settle gently
8. Brakes, hold Space to slow down

### Tips

- Don't pull too hard, small inputs! Handle everything carefully
- Watch airspeed, below 40 knots at high pitch = STALL
- Use trim, makes flying easier
- Stalling? Nose down, full throttle, wings level, wait for speed
